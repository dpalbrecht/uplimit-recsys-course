To store embeddings for 400 million users and over 100 million items and querying them in real time is a challenging task. This is where approximate nearest neighbor approaches step in to help.

We will then compare this with FAISS -- Facebook's nearest neighbour search library, and compare the time it takes for us to get nearest neighbours from FAISS versus our own implementation."
